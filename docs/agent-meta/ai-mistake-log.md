Overconfident assumption on Version.dat format -> inferred from launcher-side decoder path instead of generator behavior -> verify writer implementation first and enforce explicit plain/encrypted format contracts.
Encoding mojibake in Chinese comment -> introduced non-ASCII without verifying file encoding -> confirm encoding expectations before adding non-ASCII comments.
PowerShell text replacement wrote literal escape markers (`r`n/`t`) into C++ source -> used quoted replacement strings without validating output block -> prefer `apply_patch` for code blocks and recompile immediately after scripted replacements.
HTTP client integration compile break (WinSock redefinition + unsupported Get overload) -> introduced `httplib` without accounting for Windows include order and installed API variant -> include `winsock2.h` before `windows.h` and switch to explicit query-string request construction.
Patch merge introduced duplicate local variable (`keyPage`) -> edited around a mixed-encoding comment block without rechecking contiguous declarations -> inspect final hunk context and run compile immediately to catch/revert duplicate declarations.
PID source mismatch in CryptoLoader request path -> used `GetCurrentProcessId()` where runtime expected `_getpid()` behavior -> standardize on `_getpid()` for this launcher download pid parameter and verify with x86 build.
Added new source file but built before reconfigure, causing LNK2019 unresolved externals -> `file(GLOB ...)` source list cache was stale -> run `cmake -S . -B _builds` before build whenever source files are added or removed.
OO split introduced header dependency errors (incomplete type and missing Shell/GDI prerequisites) -> extracted classes without validating member-type/include constraints -> keep heavy types out of headers, define destructors in cpp, and compile after each extraction step.
Regex-based bulk replacement broke `Run()` block structure while fixing comments -> used broad text substitution in a mixed-encoding source -> prefer narrow `apply_patch` hunks and recompile immediately after each replacement.
Mechanical member rename replaced `VersionConfig::m_strPage` tokens -> global textual substitution ignored nested/member contexts -> constrain replacements by scope and re-scan for `config.`/type members before build.
Incremental link check after adding `WorkThreadChunkState.cpp` reported transient LNK2019 symbols -> stale intermediate build artifacts masked new object inclusion -> run `cmake --build ... --clean-first` after source-list growth before judging linkage.
Parallel Debug/Release builds against the same `_builds` directory caused false linker failures -> treated independent configs as parallel-safe though they shared intermediates -> build Debug and Release sequentially when using one build tree.
Used `&&` command chaining in Windows PowerShell where it was unsupported in this environment -> assumed shell operator compatibility -> use separate commands or `;` with explicit status checks.
