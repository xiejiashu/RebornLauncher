Overconfident assumption on Version.dat format -> inferred from launcher-side decoder path instead of generator behavior -> verify writer implementation first and enforce explicit plain/encrypted format contracts.
Encoding mojibake in Chinese comment -> introduced non-ASCII without verifying file encoding -> confirm encoding expectations before adding non-ASCII comments.
PowerShell text replacement wrote literal escape markers (`r`n/`t`) into C++ source -> used quoted replacement strings without validating output block -> prefer `apply_patch` for code blocks and recompile immediately after scripted replacements.
HTTP client integration compile break (WinSock redefinition + unsupported Get overload) -> introduced `httplib` without accounting for Windows include order and installed API variant -> include `winsock2.h` before `windows.h` and switch to explicit query-string request construction.
Patch merge introduced duplicate local variable (`keyPage`) -> edited around a mixed-encoding comment block without rechecking contiguous declarations -> inspect final hunk context and run compile immediately to catch/revert duplicate declarations.
PID source mismatch in CryptoLoader request path -> used `GetCurrentProcessId()` where runtime expected `_getpid()` behavior -> standardize on `_getpid()` for this launcher download pid parameter and verify with x86 build.
