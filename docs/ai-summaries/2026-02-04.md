# 2026-02-04 AI Session Summary

- Converted project tooling to UTF-8: global CMake `/utf-8` flags and repository-wide text recode to avoid MSVC codepage warnings.
- Added WebRTC P2P path via `libdatachannel` (new `P2PClient` and settings plumbing); WorkThread now tries P2P first with configurable STUN list, then falls back to HTTP resume.
- Rebuilt RebornLauncher UI into a standard window with P2P toggle, STUN list add/remove, status text, and dual progress bars; removed layered GDI+ scene and sprite system.
- Persisted STUN servers at `RebornLauncher/p2p_stun_servers.txt`; UI changes push settings to WorkThread; tray behavior retained.
- Documented recurring rules in `AGENTS.md`; added build dependency `libdatachannel` in `vcpkg.json` and linked `rtc` in CMake.

_Tests_: not run (build environment not invoked).
