- Fixed unterminated wide-string literals in UpdateForge window title and status messages to resolve compile errors.
- Enabled CryptoPP weak namespace for MD5 and switched to Weak::MD5 to silence warning.
- Linked comctl32 for InitCommonControlsEx and aligned MSVC runtime with vcpkg libs to fix linker errors.
- Swapped UpdateForge target to static MSVC runtime (`/MT`/`/MTd`) to match vcpkg static triplet and eliminate CMake `MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` value error; build not re-run locally because vcpkg root is outside sandbox write access.
- Ran `build_vs2022.bat`; vcpkg step failed with `permission denied` writing `G:\\vcpkg\\buildtrees\\0.vcpkg_dep_info.cmake` (root not writable in sandbox), so CMake configure aborted.
- Updated `build_vs2022.bat` to skip `vcpkg install` when local cache already exists and to force classic vcpkg mode (`VCPKG_MANIFEST_MODE=OFF`, `VCPKG_INSTALLED_DIR` set to repo cache) to avoid tool downloads.
- Rebuilt Crypto++ 8.9.0 from source with VS2022/v143 `/MT` & SDK 10.0.26100 via `_deps/cryptopp-src/build_cryptopp.cmd`; replaced `vcpkg_installed/x64-windows-static/{lib,debug/lib}/cryptopp.lib` and added minimal CMake config under `vcpkg_installed/.../share/cryptopp`.
- Copied Crypto++ headers into `vcpkg_installed/x64-windows-static/include/cryptopp`; CMake now finds `cryptopp::cryptopp` from the local config.
- After the rebuild, `cmake --build _builds --config Release|Debug` succeeds; RebornLauncher LNK4098 warning disappeared and UpdateForge links cleanly.
- Fixed UI mojibake by replacing garbled user-facing strings in `UpdateForge/UpdateForge.cpp`, `RebornLauncher/RebornLauncher.cpp`, and `RebornLauncher/WorkThread.cpp` with clean UTF-8/ASCII text (window labels/title, tray tooltip, and error prompts).
- Rebuilt both configurations: `cmake --build _builds --config Release` and `cmake --build _builds --config Debug` both succeeded after text cleanup.
- Batch-updated launcher and tool UI/log text to CN/EN bilingual wording in `UpdateForge/UpdateForge.cpp`, `RebornLauncher/RebornLauncher.cpp`, and `RebornLauncher/WorkThread.cpp`, including status labels, progress labels, message boxes, and key runtime logs.
- Ran `build_vs2022.bat` from repo root after bilingual cleanup; Release and Debug both built successfully. Remaining warnings are unchanged (`C4312` HMENU casts and one Release `LNK4098` in RebornLauncher).
- Cleaned a remaining legacy status-bar mojibake literal in `RebornLauncher/LauncherMainDlg.cpp` to bilingual text (`正在检查更新... / Checking for updates...`).
- Re-ran `build_vs2022.bat` after the final text pass; Release and Debug completed successfully with no new warnings surfaced in this run.
- Removed unintended UTF-8 BOM markers from `UpdateForge/UpdateForge.cpp`, `RebornLauncher/RebornLauncher.cpp`, and `RebornLauncher/WorkThread.cpp` to keep source encoding clean for MSVC `/utf-8` builds.
- Ran `build_vs2022.bat` again after BOM cleanup; Release/Debug succeed, with existing warnings still present (`C4312` HMENU casts, Release `LNK4098` for RebornLauncher).
- Added responsive resizing behavior for `UpdateForge.exe`: introduced `LayoutControls(...)`, `WM_SIZE` handling, and a minimum window size via `WM_GETMINMAXINFO`; path/key/generate/log controls now resize and reposition with the window.
- Batch-cleaned mojibake comments in source/CMake files with normalized CN/EN comments (`注释已清理 / Comment cleaned.`), touching `UpdateForge/*`, `RebornLauncher/*`, and top-level/relevant `CMakeLists.txt` files.
- Rebuilt using `build_vs2022.bat` after the layout and comment cleanup changes; Release and Debug both succeed (remaining warning: `C4312` in `RebornLauncher.cpp`).
- Added status bar progress UX to `UpdateForge.exe`: a bottom status bar now shows current state (`状态: 就绪/生成中`) and an embedded progress bar with overlay text (`已处理/总数`).
- Implemented threaded progress reporting via `WM_APP_PROGRESS` with payloads posted from worker threads; UI updates are marshaled on the main thread to avoid cross-thread control access.
- During this build cycle, linker initially failed because `bin/Release/UpdateForge.exe` was running; terminated the process and re-ran `build_vs2022.bat` successfully (Release + Debug passed).
- Refined the progress overlay text to explicit wording: `已处理 X / 总共 Y`, and re-verified both Release/Debug builds with `build_vs2022.bat`.
- Removed placeholder `Comment cleaned` markers from source/CMake files and replaced key `RebornLauncher.cpp` sections with concise meaningful CN/EN comments.
- Fixed launcher UI overlap/clipping by adding `LayoutMainControls(...)`, handling `WM_SIZE`, enabling resizable window style (`WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW`), and enforcing minimum size via `WM_GETMINMAXINFO`.
- Shortened bilingual launcher labels (`Status/STUN/Total/File`) to reduce text overflow while keeping dual-language readability.
- Restored `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` + `NOMINMAX` in both `RebornLauncher/framework.h` and `UpdateForge/framework.h` to fix winsock header conflicts introduced after batch comment edits.
- Rebuilt again with `build_vs2022.bat`; Release and Debug both pass (existing warnings remain: `C4312` and Release `LNK4098` in RebornLauncher).
- Added URL encryption tooling in `UpdateForge` that matches launcher-side `DecryptUrl`: UI now includes two edit boxes (URL input + hex output) and one action button (`URL加密/Encrypt URL`).
- Implemented `EncryptLauncherUrlToHex(...)` using WinCrypt (`SHA-256` + `CryptDeriveKey(CALG_AES_256)`) with the same key as launcher (`cDds!ErF9sIe6u$B`), then hex-encodes ciphertext for `ReadMe.txt`.
- Added command wiring (`IDC_BTN_URL_ENCRYPT`) and layout support for the new URL controls, plus busy-state disabling during version generation.
- Rebuilt with `build_vs2022.bat` after URL feature integration; Release and Debug both pass with no new warnings in `UpdateForge`.
- Fixed black area artifacts when enlarging `UpdateForge` window by setting `WNDCLASSEXW` redraw style (`CS_HREDRAW|CS_VREDRAW`) and a white background brush (`COLOR_WINDOW+1`) in window class registration.
- Rebuilt via `build_vs2022.bat`; first Debug link failed because `UpdateForge.exe` was running (`LNK1168`), then succeeded after stopping the process.
- Added persistent UI cache for `UpdateForge` update directory and encryption key using `UpdateForge.settings.ini` beside the executable (`LoadCachedSettings`/`SaveCachedSettings` with `GetPrivateProfileStringW` + `WritePrivateProfileStringW`).
- Cache is now written when selecting folder, before generation starts, and on app shutdown; cached values are restored on startup with fallback to `<cwd>\\Update` when no cache exists.
- Added per-file generation logs: each task now emits `处理文件 / Processing: <relative-path>` while building `Version.dat`.
- Rebuilt with `build_vs2022.bat` after cache/logging feature work; Release and Debug pass (Debug needed one retry after closing a running `UpdateForge.exe` due to `LNK1168`).
- Cached `UpdateForge` normal window size in `UpdateForge.settings.ini` (`ui.window_width`/`ui.window_height`) by loading at startup and persisting from `SaveCachedSettings()` via `GetWindowPlacement`, so enlarged size is restored on next launch.
- Re-ran `build_vs2022.bat` after window-size cache update; Release and Debug both succeed. Existing non-blocking warning remains in RebornLauncher Release: `LNK4098` (`LIBCMTD` conflict).
