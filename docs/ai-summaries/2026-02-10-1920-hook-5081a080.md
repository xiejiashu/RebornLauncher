# AI Summary

## User request
"Original request in Chinese: write a hook for the function at address 0x5081A080 using the provided decompiled signature."

## What was done
- Added a detours hook stub for sub_5081A080 with x86/x64 calling convention handling.
- Attached the hook on process attach and detached it on process detach.
- Updated the hot files index.

## Changes
- CryptoLoader/dllmain.cpp: added function pointer typedefs, hook function, and attach/detach calls.
- docs/agent-meta/hot-files-index.md: incremented access count for dllmain.cpp.

## Rationale
- Detours requires a stable function pointer and a detour with a matching signature; x86 uses fastcall with explicit edx.

## Risks + rollback
- Risk: if 0x5081A080 is an RVA rather than absolute VA, the hook will target the wrong address.
- Rollback: remove the hook additions and revert DllMain changes.

## Follow-ups/TODO
- Confirm whether 0x5081A080 is an absolute VA or module-relative RVA.
